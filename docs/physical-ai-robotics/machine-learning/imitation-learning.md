**TODO: Fill in detailed content for Imitation Learning and Learning from Demonstration here.**
This section should explain the principles, techniques, and applications of imitation learning in robotics.
Examples:
*   Behavioral cloning.
*   Inverse reinforcement learning.
*   Challenges in imitation learning (e.g., compounding errors, generalization).
*   Applications in robot manipulation, locomotion, and social tasks.
