**TODO: Fill in detailed content for Reinforcement Learning for Robotics here.**
This section should cover the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and its specific applications and challenges in the context of robotics.
Examples:
*   Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
*   Value-based and policy-based methods.
*   Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for continuous control.
*   Sim-to-real transfer in RL.
*   Challenges: sample efficiency, exploration-exploitation dilemma, safety.
*   Applications in locomotion, manipulation, and decision-making.
