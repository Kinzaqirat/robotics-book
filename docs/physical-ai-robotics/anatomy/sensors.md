# Sensors

Understand the various sensors used in humanoid robots for perception, such as vision, touch, and proprioception.

**TODO: Fill in detailed content for Sensors here.**
This section should describe the different types of sensors employed in humanoid robots, their working principles, and their roles in enabling robot perception and control.
Examples:
*   **Proprioceptive Sensors**: Encoders, IMUs (accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers), force/torque sensors.
*   **Exteroceptive Sensors**: Cameras (mono, stereo, depth), LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors, tactile sensors.
*   Sensor fusion techniques.
*   Challenges in sensor data processing and noise reduction.
