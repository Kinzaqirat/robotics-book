# Kinematics and Dynamics

Learn about the principles of kinematics and dynamics as applied to humanoid robot motion and control.

---
**TODO: Fill in detailed content for Kinematics and Dynamics here.**
This section should cover the mathematical foundations for describing robot motion and the forces/torques involved.
Examples:
*   Forward kinematics.
*   Inverse kinematics.
*   Jacobian matrix.
*   Lagrangian and Newton-Euler dynamics.
*   Trajectory generation.
*   Redundancy and manipulability.
