# Structural Components

Humanoid robots are complex machines designed to mimic the human form and capabilities. Their structural integrity and movement are enabled by several key components:

### Frames and Chassis:
- **Purpose**: Provide the foundational support and shape of the robot.
- **Materials**: Often constructed from lightweight yet strong materials like aluminum alloys, carbon fiber, or plastics.
- **Design Considerations**: Must balance rigidity for stability with flexibility for accommodating various movements and payloads. Modularity is key for maintenance and upgrades.

### Joints:
- **Purpose**: Allow for rotational or translational movement between different parts of the robot's body.
- **Types**:
    - **Revolute Joints**: Mimic human joints like elbows and knees, allowing rotation around a single axis.
    - **Prismatic Joints**: Allow linear movement, often used in specialized applications.
    - **Spherical Joints**: Offer multiple degrees of freedom, similar to shoulders and hips, enabling complex movements.
- **Degrees of Freedom (DoF)**: The number of independent parameters that define the configuration of a robotic system. Humanoid robots typically have many DoF to achieve agile and human-like movements.

### Actuators:
- **Purpose**: Generate motion by converting energy (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic) into mechanical force.
- **Types and Characteristics**:
    - **Electric Motors**: Most common in humanoids (e.g., DC motors, servo motors, stepper motors). They offer good control, precision, and are relatively quiet.
    - **Hydraulic Actuators**: Provide high power density for heavy-duty robots but are complex, noisy, and prone to leaks.
    - **Pneumatic Actuators**: Lightweight and fast, but less precise than electric or hydraulic systems.
- **Requirements for Humanoids**: Actuators for humanoids must be powerful enough for movement, compact to fit within the robot's structure, energy-efficient for extended operation, and provide precise control for delicate tasks and dynamic balance.

### Power Systems:
- **Batteries**: Rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) batteries are common due to their high energy density.
- **Power Management**: Systems to efficiently distribute power, monitor consumption, and manage charging cycles.

Understanding these components is fundamental to designing, building, and controlling humanoid robots that can effectively interact with the physical world.

### Advanced Materials:
The continuous advancement in materials science plays a crucial role in the evolution of physical AI robotics. Lightweight composites, self-healing polymers, and smart materials with properties like variable stiffness or embedded sensors are becoming increasingly important. These materials enable robots to be lighter, more durable, more energy-efficient, and capable of a wider range of interactions with their environment, including safer human-robot collaboration.
