# Balance and Locomotion

Delve into the control strategies for maintaining balance and achieving stable locomotion in humanoid robots.

**TODO: Fill in detailed content for Balance and Locomotion here.**
This section should cover the fundamental principles and advanced techniques for enabling humanoid robots to maintain balance and move effectively.
Examples:
*   Center of Mass (CoM) and Zero Moment Point (ZMP).
*   Dynamic walking and running.
*   Bipedal locomotion challenges.
*   Balance recovery strategies.
*   Gait generation and adaptation.
*   Underactuated systems and control.
