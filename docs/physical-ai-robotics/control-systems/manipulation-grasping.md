# Manipulation and Grasping

Explore control techniques for robotic manipulation and grasping, focusing on how humanoids interact with objects.

**TODO: Fill in detailed content for Manipulation and Grasping here.**
This section should cover the principles, algorithms, and challenges associated with robotic manipulation and grasping, particularly for humanoid robots.
Examples:
*   Kinematic and dynamic modeling for manipulation.
*   Grasping taxonomies and strategies (e.g., power grasp, precision grasp).
*   Force control and impedance control.
*   Tactile sensing for manipulation.
*   Manipulation in unstructured environments.
*   Human-inspired manipulation skills.
