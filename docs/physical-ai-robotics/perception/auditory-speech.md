**TODO: Fill in detailed content for Auditory Processing and Speech Recognition here.**
This section should cover the techniques and challenges involved in enabling humanoid robots to perceive and understand auditory information, including human speech.
Examples:
*   Microphone arrays and sound localization.
*   Noise reduction and speech enhancement.
*   Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems.
*   Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding commands and context.
*   Text-to-Speech (TTS) for robot verbal responses.
*   Emotion detection from vocal cues.
